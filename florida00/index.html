<h1>
Florida, 2000</h1></center>

<p><br>This year's vacation travels took us to Florida, where we met with
some family members and enjoyed the sun and warm weather.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
first few days were spent in Cocoa Beach, giving us the chance to relax while sitting on the beach or by the pool.&nbsp; While there,
we were also able to pay a visit to Kennedy Space Center.&nbsp; The second
half of the trip was spent at Disney World, endlessly jumping from park
to park trying to pack every ounce of the Disney universe into the few
short days we had there.
<p>The links provided below will take you to pictures we've compiled from
the trip.&nbsp; Feel free to browse through them at your leisure.&nbsp;
Enjoy!
