<b>A Day in the Life of Amelia!</b></h2></center>
<b>We had lots of fun at the gym, but mommy forgot to take pictures even
though she knew the camera was in the diaper bag.&nbsp; So after the gym,
we went home and ate dinner-- Boca Nuggets! Ummmmm!&nbsp; We had peas too,
but I didn't want any of them-- yuck!</b>

<p><b>And after dinner Andy and I took baths.&nbsp; Tonight we decided
to play in the water together!</b>

and I played trains with daddy!</b>

<p><b>But I got tired, so at around 9:30p.m. mommy and daddy gave me a
bottle and then I went to sleep.</b>
