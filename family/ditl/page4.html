<b>A Day in the Life of Amelia!</b></h2></center>
<b>And after lunch we went for a walk because it was such a nice day.&nbsp;
Daddy came home for lunch right as we were leaving, so he took our picture--
we were both really surprised to see his car pull up in the driveway &amp;
couldn't take our eyes off it!</b>

<p><b>The walk made me sleepy, so I took a nap.&nbsp; Andy stayed up a
bit longer than me, but he fell asleep too.</b>

<p><b>And when I got back home, I decided to make some music, one of my
favorite things to do!</b>

<p><b>And after a while, mommy took us to play at the gym.&nbsp; We play
with other kids there while mommy works out.</b>
