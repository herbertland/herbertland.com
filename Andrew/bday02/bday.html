<p>Friends and family helped to celebrate Andy's 2nd birthday a few days
early while Aunt Annette &amp; her family were visiting for the holidays.&nbsp;
A few days later, Andy celebrated his real birthday with his mommy, daddy,
and little sister.&nbsp; Below are a few pictures of the party and his
day at home.&nbsp; Enjoy!
