<br>Amelia's hair took to Hawaii's climate very well, look at all those
curls!&nbsp; While not a big fan of the ocean, she had a great time playing
on the beach.&nbsp; Here she is watching daddy snorkel at Lydgate State
Park..

<br>Andy playing at the beach, naturally deflecting any sunlight.&nbsp;
His hair got curly in the Hawaiian air as well, though it's a lot shorter
and less obvious than his sister.&nbsp; And enough 50 SPF sunblock was
applied to both kids so that no one got a sunburn.

take to cold ocean water.&nbsp; She preferred the sand of the beach over
the ocean.
