            <P>Wendy's chili is <I>not </I>made out of people -- well, it is, 
            but just a little bit.</P>
            <P>Santa Clara County health officials confirmed Wednesday that the 
            thing a woman bit on when enjoying her chili at a Monterey Highway 
            Wendy's was, in fact, a human finger. They're not sure whose.</P>
            <P>It was about an inch-and-a-half, with a longish, nicely groomed 
            nail.</P>
            <P>And while it gave the woman -- Anna Ayala, 39, of Las Vegas -- a 
            bad case of the willies, it likely caused no physical illness, 
            officials said.</P>
            <P>That's because the finger was safely cooked, simmering along at 
            170 degrees with more traditional chili ingredients, such as 
            tomatoes, beef and beans.</P>
            <P>About 7:20 p.m. Tuesday, Ayala, in town with her family to drop 
            off her in-laws who live in San Jose, scooped up a mouthful of 
            chili.</P>
            <P>It was her first visit to a Wendy's. ``I'm more of a Carl's Jr. 
            person,'' she said Thursday night.</P>
            <P>``Suddenly something crunchy was in my mouth,'' she said, ``and I 
            spit it out.''</P>
            <P>After much examination, she and her tablemates realized just what 
            the special ingredient was. Then the vomiting commenced.</P>
            <P>Police and county health officials were called to the Wendy's, 
            but no one there was missing any digits.</P>
            <P>``We had everyone kind of show us they had 10 fingers, and 
            everything was OK there,'' said Ben Gale, director of the county's 
            Department of Environmental Health.</P>
            <P>In confirming it was a finger, the county medical examiner also 
            found that it wasn't badly decomposed and had a solid set of 
            fingerprints. Conceivably, officials said, police could lift a print 
            and perhaps match it to a partially fingered person through a 
            database.</P>
            <P>For now, officials figure -- since it was a jagged cut -- it may 
            have happened on a meat grinder.</P>
            <P>In any case, the county shut the Wendy's for a while and 
            impounded all the remaining chili and all the ingredients used to 
            make it. They hope to track all the fixings to try to find the 
            source of the finger.</P>
            <P>Wendy's spokesman Bob Bertini said never in the fast-food chain's 
            35 years has a body part showed up in the food.</P><!-- end body-content --><!-- begin body-end -->
