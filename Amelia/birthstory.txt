Amelia's birth story...

We arrived at the hospital at 4:30 a.m. on Monday 4/29/02. I changed into my lovely gown, we got paperwork done & they started Pitocin around 5:30 a.m. At 6:00 I was 3 cm dialated, 70% effaced, soft but very VERY high (she crawled back up since my last appt :lol ), & having regular contractions that didn't hurt, & I started to complain about it being too easy :lol Well, that all changed at 8:30 when my dr checked in with her crochet hook thingee & broke my water! By 8:45 the contractions hurt, BAD! I survived for awhile & got my epidural at 10:30, 4-5cm dialated. I was happy after that with the exception of one incident... At one point I got very dizzy & clamy. Turns out my bp dropped from 141/89 to 94/56! That was NOT fun-- all kinds of people ran in & I turned onto my other side. It steadied out so I was ok after that & my bp stayed around 116/74 for the duration. The nurse said that I had some reaction from my epi dr's "cocktail." Just one of those random things I guess.

At 12:30 the nurse came in & checked me-- 7-8cm, 95% effaced, still high but a little lower-- my dr suspected I wouldn't drop until the baby was ready to make its appearance. She (the dr) came in at 1:30-- no change & said we have about 2 hours left. 

15 minutes later I thought I had the urge to push & tell the nurse. She checks me again & congratualtes me because I was complete & the baby is right there, & calls the dr back over. Dr comes running in out of breath-- her office is across the street so she decided to run, puts on some gloves & tells me to push. I pushed-- almost, but not quite there, push again, & a few more times & the "ring of fire" sets in. It hurt like hell (don't remember that with ds at all!) 

After about 5 mins, the dr put a heart monitor on the baby's head-- her heartrate dropped from 113 to 70 during the pushing! They told me the baby needed to come out but the head was a little too big (surprise surprise) & I wasn't stretching well from my last episiotomy-- the scar was too thick, so she did a tiny episiotomy (ouch!). Everything hurt so much! I had my eyes closed while pushing & couldn't figure out what was happening down there! My dr told me to open my eyes & I saw my little daughter being born! I was incredible! Once she was out I held her for a few minutes before they cleaned her up (& verified she was in fact a she :lol They claned me up a bit, gave me the baby & dh, dd, & I were left alone. After a few minutes dh suggested the name Amelia Erin (we never even mentioned Erin before), & it just sounded right, so the name decision was made. :) 

That night we celebrated with pizza!!!!! We went home the next afternoon after we both saw our dr's. She's a little mixed up on nights & days which has been hard, but she's generally quiet & ds has pretty much accepted her as a permanent fixture in our house but is still keeping a little distance from her.

I can't believe I have two babies now, although ds seems a little more like a boy now instead of a baby. I love both of them so much! I'm the luckiest person on earth!!!
