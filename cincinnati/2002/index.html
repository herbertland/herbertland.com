<p>Amelia's first airplane ride took her to Cincinnati where she was introduced
to many, many people.&nbsp; Both Andy &amp; Amelia were excellent travelers!&nbsp;
While in Cincinnati Andy attended his first professional baseball game,
discovered the joy of playing with Matchbox cars, &amp; mommy &amp; daddy
were able to go out without the kids to grab some Skyline one night &amp;
go to Kings Island another (thank you Grandma!)&nbsp; Pictures from the
trip can be found below-- Enjoy!
