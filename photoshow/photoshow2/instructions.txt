- To see your published show double click on the index.html file.

- To publish your show online you will need a web site and a way 
of getting these files to your web site.

- You can also easily share your show online by choosing the 
"E-mail a Link" option in the share screen of PhotoShow Deluxe.

- When you upload your Show to your website, index.html will be 
the file that you link to in order to allow people to see your show.

- After you upload your show, make sure that all the folders and files get 
uploaded in the same configuration as on your computer.

- If your FTP client does not support drag and drop, make sure to name all 
the folders in the exact same way as they are on your computer. The folder 
names on the server must have the exact same spelling and capitalization as on 
your computer.

- Have fun sharing your photos with PhotoShow Deluxe!
